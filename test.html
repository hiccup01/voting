	<h2>Should prisoners be able to vote?</h2>
	<p><i>Do</i> we all have civil rights? Should we all have the right to vote all the time? Even when we’re sentenced? It’s a controversial issue, with lots of viewpoints and reasons behind them. This website aims to explore them and help you make up your mind.</p>

<p>Let’s first start with the views from the pro-enfranchismentists. In their view they think that prisoners should all be able to vote or there should be very few criteria disqualifying their right to vote. In their opinion, giving all prisoners the right to vote will expose them to what’s actually happening in the outside world, instead of being in a locked down, information scarce environment, that makes it harder for them to reconnect with the real world once they actually leave prison. Another reason, according to the Politico Magazine, is that letting prisoners vote will help improve a dysfunctional prison system (Things like fight clubs, Prisoners beating each other up and the fairly appalling standards that they live by), because more than anyone, prisoners know the problems with prison system. Why should you have to be governed by laws during and after you go to prison when you have no choice over what they are. A final and more data-driven approach, is that statistically, there are more Māori people in prison than in the general population, this means the native population of our country’s vote is underrepresented in our government.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at what the pro-disenfranchisementists have to say. They think prisoners make the choice to give up the right to vote when they get sent to prison, even if they were wrongly convicted. In their opinion: <blockquote cite="http://www.debate.org/opinions/should-prisoners-be-allowed-to-vote/arguments/3B9B46D8-9552-4332-A5B7-D39B8C0B1C4B">"They are in prison, they could be a rapist, murderer, psychopath, pedo, and you think it is okay for them to vote -- They are bad people, and would only want to harm society. They don’t care about you, only themselves."</blockquote>I think they say this because they think that the people being sent to prison have something wrong in their head, but often I think that most people were in the wrong situation at the wrong time and can be helped back into law-abiding society. Another thing they might say is that taking away people’s civil rights will encourage them to think about what they have done, however, In my opinion taking away prisoners’ sense of control of the world around them may cause them to commit more crimes.</p>

<p>Now on to what I think! In my opinion almost all prisoners should be able to vote, as it’s their civil right to do so and they should be able to exercise it. However, I do propose an exception to this rule; I think that prisoners sentenced to the maximum prison sentence should not be able to vote in the first election that falls in their term. This is because people sentenced for that long most likely have some sort of psychological issues going on, so this makes sure that there’s ample time to make sure that these people are in a position as to cast a sensible vote.
</br>As part of my new policy I think that we should have some sort of a programme running in prison that helps prisoners keep contact with the outside world via varied and diverse media. This would make prisoners’ day more interesting and might even help stop things like fight clubs if the prisoners don’t have to make their own fun. Another reason I think prisoners should be able to vote is that there’s not enough of them to significantly skew the results, but if they were voting to improve the quality of prisons then, because the general public would likely vote for it as well, it would pass.</p>

<p>In summary, this is a complex issue with lots of different (and strong) opinions on it. If reading this has helped you make up your mind then maybe you should consider sending a letter to your local MP, as the current law deregisters prisoners to vote when they get sentenced, meaning they have to reregister once left to be able to vote again.
